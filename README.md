# Loco Tower Decompilation
A work in progress decompilation of Loco Tower

This Decomp is not finished, but is Playable

GameMaker Version Used: 2023.8

## Current Progress
Game does load, and it is very Playable, but can be laggy

Things I have Done:
- Fixed any scripts that failed to decompile or caused memory leaks/crashes, using an unofficial build of UTMT that uses UnderAnalyzer instead of GML Decompiler
> Unofficial UTMT with UnderAnalyzer: https://nightly.link/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/actions/artifacts/1814233921.zip

## Issues
- States have not been changed to use Enums
- Decomp is currently not organized

> Note that not much PlayTesting has been done

### Thanks to
- QuantumV, for his decompiler
- The Loco Tower Developers, for making Loco Tower
- The Underminers Team, for making UTMT

Note that none of the people mentioned above know me/know I even made this decomp
> they probably would also probably hate me if they knew I existed
